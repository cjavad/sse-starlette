DEMONSTRATION: Graceful Server Shutdown

PURPOSE:
Shows what happens to active SSE connections when server shuts down gracefully
vs when it's killed forcefully.

KEY LEARNING:
- Graceful shutdown allows streams to complete current operations
- Clients receive proper connection close signals
- Cleanup code in generators gets executed

PATTERN:
Using signal handlers and proper async cleanup ensures data integrity.
