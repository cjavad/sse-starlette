"""
DEMONSTRATION: Memory Channels Alternative to Generators

PURPOSE:
Shows how to use anyio memory channels instead of async generators
for SSE streaming, providing better control over data flow.

KEY LEARNING:
- Memory channels decouple data production from consumption
- Better error handling and resource management
- More flexible than generators for complex scenarios

PATTERN:
Producer-consumer pattern using memory channels for SSE.

    MEMORY CHANNEL BENEFITS:
    - Better separation of concerns (producer vs consumer)
    - Built-in backpressure handling
    - Multiple producers can feed one stream
    - More robust error handling
    - Easier testing and debugging

    WHEN TO USE:
    - Complex data processing pipelines
    - Multiple data sources
    - Need for buffering and flow control
